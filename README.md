# HW to Chapter 9 "Fitting, Bias, Regularization, and Dropout"

## Name : Harshila Jagtap 

NEU ID : 002743674 

## Question :

1. Implement regularization algorithms in your neural network.
2. Implement dropout algorithms in your neural network.

## Pre-requisite :

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Python

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60000, 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. More details about the datset can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Sample images from each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown below:

![Original CIFAR-10 dataset](https://github.com/harshilaNEU/Neural_Networks/blob/Training_Sets/Reference_Images/Downloaded_CIFAR-10_data.png)

5000 : train, 1000 test, 80% - 20% train validate ratio
Folder: data
Train
Validate
Test

## Steps to generate the prototype of train, validate, test

1. Take clone of repository.
2. switch to branch "Dropout"
3. Locate jupyter_notebook "regularization_dropout.ipynb"
4. Run the notebook "regularization_dropout.ipynb"
