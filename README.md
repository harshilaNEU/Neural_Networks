# HW to Chapter 3 “The Perceptron for Logistic Regression“

## Name : Harshila Jagtap 

NEU ID : 002743674 

## Question :

1. Prepare a set of grayscale images of handwritten labeled numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as input for training neural networks. The size of the images is 20 x 20. Make 10 different images of reach number written a little differently.
2. Prepare some test images (not labeled) for testing the trained Perceptron.
3. Develop the software for the Perceptron with input, parameters as transmission matrix and bias including the module for their initiation (setting their initial values), sigmoid activation function, loss function generation, forward and backpropagation paths, gradient descent algorithm for training. Make sure that the software allows easy change of set of images, activation function (various activation functions may be used in the future),
4. Initiate the parameters (transmission matrix and bias).
5. Try to train and test the Perceptron.
6. Do not get disappointed if you face hardship in training the Perceptron. Try to resolve the problems, consult with the TA, and collect the unresolved problems for a discussion in the next class.

## Pre-requisite :

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Python
