## Question :

Develop a prototype of the training, validation, and testing sets of your choice for the future training of your neural network. The term “prototype: means that the sets may be quite limited by number of images, but the proportions of images in them should be maintained as required

## Pre-requisite :

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Python

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60000, 32×32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. More details about the datset can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Sample images from each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown below:
