## Name : Harshila Jagtap 

NEU ID : 002743674 

## Question :

1. Implement regularization algorithms in your neural network.
2. Implement dropout algorithms in your neural network.
3. Implement input normalization algorithm. 

## Pre-requisite :

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Python

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60000, 32×32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. More details about the datset can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Sample images from each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown below:

5000 : train, 1000 test, 80% - 20% train validate ratio
Folder: data
Train
Validate
Test

## Steps to generate the prototype of train, validate, test

1. Take clone of repository.
2. switch to branch "Dropout"
3. Unzip the data.zip file
4. Locate jupyter_notebook "regularization_dropout.ipynb"
5. Run the notebook "regularization_dropout.ipynb"
