# HW to Chapter 4, 5 “One Hidden Layer”

## Name : Harshila Jagtap 

NEU ID : 002743674 

## Question :

1.    Start developing a Neural Network with one hidden layer
2.    Use object-oriented approach.
3.    Recommended class structure:
       Class – Activation
       Class – Neuron
       Class – Layer
       Class – Parameters
       Class – Model (start with Neural Network with one hidden layer
       Class – LossFunction
       Class – ForwardProp
       Class – BackProp
       Class – GradDescent
       Class – Traning
4.    Feel free to use a different set of classes if find appropriate 
5.    Consult with TA (Meet Doshi) on the class hierarchy design and software development.
6.    Do as much as you can but do it.

## Pre-requisite :

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Python
